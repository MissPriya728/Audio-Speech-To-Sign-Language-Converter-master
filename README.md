# Audio-Speech-To-Sign-Language-Converter-master
The Audio-Speech-To-Sign-Language-Converter-master project likely focuses on translating spoken language (audio input or  text input ) into sign language, either through animations or text-based representations. This tool aims to facilitate communication between individuals who use spoken language and those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
